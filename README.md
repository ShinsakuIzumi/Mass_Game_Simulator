# Mass Game Simulator
This is a simulator of *multiagent mass games*.

## Multiagent Mass Games [1,2]
In multiagent mass games, agents achieve formations displaying *grayscale images* by distributed control. One potential application of mass games is entertainment, where we can observe agent formations displaying objects shown in pictures.

## Mass Game Simulator
The mass game simulator (MGS) has been developed to overcome difficulties in implementing algorithms for simulating mass games. With the MGS, it is possible to simply simulate a mass game through mouse and keyboard operations without the need for expert knowledge or programming effort. The main features of the MGS are as follows:
- Importing user-selected image files (.jpg and .bmp), 
- Simulating mass games for the imported images, 
- Displaying the simulation results as figures and animations, 
- Saving the simulation results as image and movie files.

## Install
The MGS is provided as a MATLAB application installer file (MGS.mlappinstall). Download the file and install it into your computer with MATLAB.

## Usage
The usage of the MGS will be explained in [3] (in press).
