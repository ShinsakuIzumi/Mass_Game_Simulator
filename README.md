# Mass Game Simulator
This is a simulator of *multi-agent mass games*.

## Multi-Agent Mass Games [1,2]
In multiagent mass games, agents achieve formations displaying *grayscale images* by distributed control. One potential application of mass games is entertainment, where we can observe the interesting behavior of agents to represent objects and situations depicted in images.

## Mass Game Simulator
The mass game simulator (MGS) has been developed to overcome difficulties in implementing algorithms for simulating mass games. With the MGS, it is possible to simulate mass games only through mouse and keyboard operations without the need for expert knowledge or programming effort. The main features of the MGS are as follows:
- Importing user-selected image files (.jpg and .bmp), 
- Simulating mass games for the imported images, 
- Displaying the simulation results as figures and animations, 
- Saving the simulation results as image and movie files.

## Install
The MGS is provided as a MATLAB application installer file (MGS.mlappinstall). Download the file and install it into your computer with MATLAB.

## Usage
The usage of the MGS is explained in [3]. You can also see a demonstration video of the MGS as the graphical abstract of [3].
