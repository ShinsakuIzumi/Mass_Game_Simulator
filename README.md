# Mass Game Simulator
The mass game simulator (MGS) has been developed for an application of control theory to entertainment. With the MGS, it is possible to simply simulate a mass game through mouse and keyboard operations without the need for expert knowledge or programming effort. The main features of the MGS are as follows:
1) Importing user-selected image files (.jpg and .bmp), 
2) Simulating mass games for the imported images, 
3) Displaying the simulation results as figures and animations, 
4) Saving the simulation results as image and movie files.

## Install
The MGS is provided as a MATLAB application installer file (MGS.mlappinstall). Download the file and install it into your computer with MATLAB.

## Usage
The usage of the MGS will be explained in the following reference (published later).
